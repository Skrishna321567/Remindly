# Project description
We are trying to create a reminder app which reminds about homeworks to students.
# The Problem statement
Many students struggle to keep track of their homework assignments, leading to missed deadlines, poor grades, and increased stress. Existing solutions like paper planners, digital calendars, or reminders from teachers often prove inadequate, as they can be easily forgotten, lost, or overlooked.
# The solution
Provide a user-friendly platform for students to track and manage homework and assignments.
 Send timely reminders and notifications to ensure students stay on top of their work.
 Facilitate communication between students, teachers, and parents.
 Help students develop essential time management and organization skills.
